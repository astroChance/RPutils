# RPutils
## Python library for extraterrestrial rock physics

This library contains several rock physics models, utilities, and functions to help describe the elastic properties of rocks and granular media. Much of this code is based on equations presented in The Rock Physics Handbook (Mavko et al.), see docstrings for additional references.

This initial purpose of this library is to support rock physics modeling of lunar regolith simulant. More information can be found in the [LunarIce repository](https://github.com/astroChance/LunarIce)
