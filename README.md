# RPutils
## Python library for extraterrestrial rock physics

This library contains several rock physics models, utilities, and functions to help describe the elastic properties of rocks and granular media. Much of this code is based on equations presented in The Rock Physics Handbook (Mavko et al.), see docstrings for additional references.
